# Password Generator

This weeks challenge was to create an applicatiopn that can be used to create a random password based on criteria
selected.

- WHEN I click the button to generate a password
  THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
- WHEN prompted for password criteria
  THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
- WHEN prompted for the length of the password
  THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
  THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- WHEN I answer each prompt
  THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
- WHEN all prompts are answered
  THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
- WHEN the password is generated
  THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
